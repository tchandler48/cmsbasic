	The CMSBASIC system has been developed using VM370 6Pack Extened
       and VM370CE.  It MAY work on other VM releases or MAY not.

	To install the CMSBASIC on your running VM370 CMS
	sysem, follow the steps listed below.

	1.	The following source code must be uploaded to the
		distribution that you are using (See Systems Tested)
		and Userid that your are loading under.
			clr3270.assemble
                     TBASIC.exec

Sytems Tested

	The following VM370 distribuion have been used to test CMSBASIC.  Any
	system not listed, MAY work, but I have not tested via them.
	I have only tested under the users that is listed in the
	system description.  Other user id's on the system MAY OR MAY NOT
	work.


	1.  VM370 6Pack Extended by Prof. Ferland at:
           	https://geronimo370.nl/vm6pext/vm-370/

           Tested under Userid:
		GCCCMS
			Runs without any changes.

		CMSUSER  ** NOTE **
			You must do the following to make CMSBASIC compile and
			run under the CMSUSER ID.
			Logon on to CMSUSER and wait until CMS is running.
			Then type:
				CP DEF STOR 15M
			The system will respond with a message about storage	
			size and respond with a CP message. 
			Then type:
				IPL CMS
			After CMS is running,
			Type:
				GLOBAL TXTLIB PDPCLIB

			The system is now ready applications.


	2.  VM370CE uses the same instructions as VM370 6Pack Extened.


	3.  Other VM370 platforms MAY or MAY NOT work.
