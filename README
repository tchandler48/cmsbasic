This is CMSBASIC.  I ported over gpl bxbasic to
run via vm370 cms.  The code has beeb tested ib
VM370 6PExt,  It should run under other versions, if
you have the GCC compiler and runtime installed.


Installing:

To install CMSBASIC, transfer all source code into your vm370 machine.
I use GCCCMS in my test system.

Once the code is transfered, then compile the CMSBASIC code by
typing:

gcc CMSBASIC C
s
You should get a clean compile.

Next type the following commands:

LOAD CMSBASIC
GENMOD CMSBASIC
RENAME LOAD MAP A CMSBASIC MAP A


Now to execute programs

Sample program bx10 bas, type the command

CMSBASIC BX10 BAS

you should get a sample program executed.
