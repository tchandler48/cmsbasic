This is CMSBASIC.  I ported over gpl bxbasic to
run via vm370 cms

Installing:

To install CMSBASIC, transfer all source code into your vm370 machine.
I use GCCCMS in my test system.

Once the code is transfered, then compile the CMSBASIC code by
typing:

gcc CMSBASIC C

You should get a clean compile.

Next type the following commands:

LOAD CMSBASIC
GENMOD CMSBASIC
RENAME LOAD MAP A CMSBASIC MAP A


Now to execute programs

Sample program bx10 bas, type the command

CMSBASIC BX10 BAS

you should get a sample program executed.





TO DO:

Adding code to support TCP via NICOF package.  Work in
progress.
