This is CMSBASIC.  I ported over gpl bxbasic to
run via vm370 cms

Installing:

To install CMSBASIC, transfer all source code into your vm370 machine.
I use GCCCMS in my test system.

Once the code is transfered, then compile the CMSBASIC code by
typing:

gcc CMSBASIC C

You should get a clean compile.
